Timesheet Bot v1.1

Timesheet bot is designed to help with the process of filling out timesheet where necessary. This is a very basic script and designed for use with a specific template. I am new to programming so this is my first foray into it. 

This aims to help in a few areas that become laborious - 

	•	Calculating your hours worked
	•	Auto-filling your working dates 
	•	Filling out your location (if you work at the same site frequently) 

Future features I would like to develop - 

	•	Calculate overtime based on a 10hr or 12hr work day
	•	Calculate if turn around was broken and by how much
	•	Ask you which days of the week you worked and adjust the input into the timesheet accordingly
	•	Ability to not only check for the OpenPyXL module but also install it if not found. 

//PLEASE NOTE THIS USES THE OPENPYXL MODULE//
